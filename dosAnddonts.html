            Park Offenses</h2>

        <p>SGNP is one of the most unique Protected Areas, a real tropical wilderness nestling right amidst massive
            urban development. It is hoped you will treat these outdoors with the same respect that you treat your home
            indoors. You are fortunate that you can experience this wilderness on foot, a facility not available or
            allowed in most National Parks and Wildlife Sanctuaries across India. Have a great experience, both, of the
            natural world as well as the specially created informative signages along the paths and paved roads as you
            explore this wilderness. Please follow these simple rules while you are here:</p>
